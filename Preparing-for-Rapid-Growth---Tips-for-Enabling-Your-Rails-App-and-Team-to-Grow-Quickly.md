**Presenter:** Patrick Leonard

## Abstract

> Every young company expects to grow quickly, but is your engineering team really ready for it? In 3 years, iTriage went from a kitchen table to one of the leading mobile consumer healthcare apps with over 5 million downloads. Staying ahead of this growth didn't just mean hiring more Rails engineers.
>
> Patrick will discuss what iTriage did (and continues to do) to stay ahead of our growth, including: 
>
> * Technical architecture, including use of Rails Engines to enable a modular, RESTful service-based design
> * Enabling high quality iPhone, Android and Web apps 
> * Development and release management processes 
> * Recruiting and hiring approaches
