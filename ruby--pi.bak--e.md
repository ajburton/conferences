(Missed the first part)

* `zsh` has escape hacks
* `bash`: `pushd`, `popd`, `dirs -v`
* `zsh`: can just do `Downloads` instead of `cd Downloads`
* `z`: (project on github)
    * Looks at directories you've been in and completes
* Completions:
    * Arrow completion (`ls` then hit up and down)

OS X only:

* `open`
* `pbcopy`, `pbpaste`

Linux (and newer OS X):

* `pgrep` and `pkill`

More `zsh`:

* custom prompts
* `zsh` syntax highlighting as you write!  :) https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting

Old school:

* wc sed awk find awk (TODO and more?  I think there were 7)

Others:

* pipebench
* tcpdump
* curl, httpie
