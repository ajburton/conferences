From [[Goruco 2012]]

**Presenter:** Justin Leitgeb

## Bio

> Justin has been programming for more than 15 years, with the last five primarily in Ruby. He has an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and graduate degrees in Sociology and Spanish Literature. He ties these interests together as CEO and Lead Developer of Stack Builders, a Ruby consultancy based in New York and Colombia, South America.

## Abstract

> Most Ruby programmers spend significant time writing, maintaining and troubleshooting automated tests. While recent discussions in the Ruby community have focused on whether we're writing too few or too many tests, this talk looks at how we can write "sensible" tests that allow our applications to deliver the most possible value with the least amount of development time and effort.

## Notes

TODO

From @username1:

* This layout is just a suggestion.
* It's kinda based on how Wikipedia is organized (e.g. an "External Links" section)
* Bullet points might work well.  Paragraphs too.  Up to you.  :)
* This section is probably enough, but just in case here are some other ideas...

From @username2:

* It's best to leave "username dividers" to prevent merge conflicts later.

## Discussion

TODO

* If some stuff is controversial, thought provoking, etc, we can have something like this.
* Kind of like "Talk" pages on Wikipedia.
