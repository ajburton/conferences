## Notes

From @benjaminoakes:

* DRW Trading Group (hiring)
* Rspec2
    * Micronaut:  Each example has its own metadata
    * New basis for Rspec

```ruby
example_group = describe Something { }
```

```ruby
example = it 'does something' { }
```

* Used in output at command line, etc.
* rspec has formatter methods
