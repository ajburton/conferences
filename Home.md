Crowd-sourced RailsConf notes!  Working together is better.  :)

## The Idea

* Internet access generally sucks at events like this.  This wiki [works offline](https://github.com/newhavenrb/railsconf2012/wiki/_access); it's just a `git` repo full of Markdown files.
* This is like Wikipedia, but for RailsConf notes.
* We want to share.  All contributions are welcome (notes, summaries, discussions, slide links, related links, etc).
* Miss a talk?  We've got your back.

## What you can do

* Please pass the word along!  More eyes and contributors == more better.
* Read the notes; fix typos, awkward wording as necessary
* Add links; links to slides, related sites, videos, etc. are very desireable.
* Have notes for something we don't have?  We want them.
* Have notes for something we **do** have?  We want those too.  Either add them in a separate section or integrate them with existing notes.
* Write/improve a talk summary
* Anything else that you feel makes an improvement.  :)

## Other Stuff

* Please add a section for your notes (e.g. `### From @yourname`) in the notes section to help reduce merge conflicts
* You don't have to fork (actually, GitHub doesn't handle forking wikis all that well); just [clone](https://github.com/newhavenrb/railsconf2012/wiki/_access), make your changes, commit, and push like you would for code.
* This is an index page.  It has a list of talks, each of which can have their own page(s).
* It's just a suggestion, but here's a [[template]] for notes.
* Beyond `git` and a text editor, there's a [[software]] list that might help you out.

Not a member of the [newhavenrb](https://github.com/newhavenrb) organization and want to contribute?  You should be able to edit via the web interface and make a clone (but not push).  But if you run into a problem, send us a message via GitHub or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/newhavenrb), or if you just want to make a small contribution, [fork and make a pull request](https://github.com/newhavenrb/railsconf2012).
