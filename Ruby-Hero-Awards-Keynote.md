**Presenter:** Ruby Hero Awards

## Abstract

> There are many people in the Ruby/Rails world who contribute to our community and rarely receive any recognition or payment for their work.
>
> They create educational content, develop plugins & gems, contribute to open source projects, and even put on events which help educate and make our lives as developers easier.
>
> Ruby Heroes was created to show some gratitude and give these people the recognition they deserve. Hopefully the type of recognition that keeps them doing what theyâ€™re doing, and continuing to make our community stronger.
