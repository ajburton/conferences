### Under the C: Ruby C Extensions

by [[Mike Laurence]]

Why?

* Low level C libs
* Faster

Why not?

* Documentation kinda sucks
* Intimidating
* etc

How much work for a C extension?

* `extconf.rb`, `mkmf` (happens as a part of the gem install)
* Ruby-to-C interface (Ruby provides a lib)
* Do some type conversion, etc
