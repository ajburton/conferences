### PgPower: Rails Postrges for Power Users

### Under the C: Ruby C Extensions

by [[Mike Laurence]]

Why?

* Low level C libs
* Faster

Why not?

* Documentation kinda sucks
* Intimidating
* etc

How much work for a C extension?

* `extconf.rb`, `mkmf` (happens as a part of the gem install)
* Ruby-to-C interface (Ruby provides a lib)
* Do some type conversion, etc

### Coding Without Electricity

by [[Kyle Crum]]

* In Burma
* Very little technology penetration
* "Lemons and all that"
* "Libraries and books... weird"

Tips for life:

1. Do something scary hard
2. Fix the problem -- do what you need to and move on
3. Look up (from your computer)
