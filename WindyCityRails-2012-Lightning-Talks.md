From @benjaminoakes:

### PowerEnum 

by [[Arthur Shagall]]

* At same company as [[Mike Sandler]] (TMXCredit)
* ActiveRecord with slug lookup, basically
* `Something[:foo]` gives you an `ActiveRecord` instance
* Gem: [`power_enum`](http://rubygems.org/gems/power_enum)

### Build your next app using Meteor

by [[Turiy Dybskiy]]

* [7 Principles of Meteor](http://docs.meteor.com/#sevenprinciples)
* Live coding (had a few problems)

### PgPower: Rails Postrges for Power Users

by [[Mike Sandler]]

* At same company as [[Arthur Shagall]] (TMXCredit)
* Schema dumping becomes hard when doing migrations with raw SQL
* PgPower helps out; augments the migrations DSL
* Gem: [`pg_power`](http://rubygems.org/gems/pg_power)

### Under the C: Ruby C Extensions

by [[Mike Laurence]]

Why?

* Low level C libs
* Faster

Why not?

* Documentation kinda sucks
* Intimidating
* etc

How much work for a C extension?
