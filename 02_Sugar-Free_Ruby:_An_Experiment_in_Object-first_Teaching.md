# Sugar-Free Ruby: An Experiment in Object-first Teaching
## Steven! Ragnar√∂k

## Introduction

Sugar Free emphasizes Ruby is Objects

## Teaching Programming

If we don't teach it, its going away

You owe it to your teachers to continue the tradition

Teaching programming is very hard!!
  * Its really hard to learn to program
    * Your assumptions aren't natural
    * Takes a lot of empathy
  * Its hard to share something valuable
   * We always want to gain value out of an interaction
   * You will be rewarded for your knowledge and sharing!

It takes a lot of self reflection to teach well
Just like getting better at programming, you must always be a student

## CoderDojo

Dedicated to setting up kids coding projects
In small groups, children learn to program
Kids learn that *Programming Is Fun!*
 * Encourages children to continue to program
 * Its best way to engage kids, to make an activity fun

## Rails Bridge

For anyone in this world, programming is hard but attainable
Focus on fun parts like Rails instead of install language and dependencies

## Challenge with Teaching Ruby

You have to know why the student is trying to learn
You have to ask, "Why do you want to learn Ruby?"
 * I hate my job and programmers make bank
 * I know how to program but not Ruby, the Ruby community is awesome!
 * I'm curious about programming


## How are we teaching Ruby right now?

 * Data types
 * True and false
 * Collection structures
 * Expressions
 * Console
 * Variables
 * Conditionals
 * Loops
 * If we are lucky, we might talk about `foo.upcase` aka objects

Where is the students mind blown? Information overload.

Whats wrong with this picture is too many concepts before discussing
methods or even mentioning classes.

Ruby is not a computer a language!
Ruby doesn't care its on a computer.

## Teach Ruby as Objects!

Reservation: students head will explode, but it already does with first
way to teach via data types through loops.

Give the students an idea of Objects and let them explore via irb

Use #send to emphasize message passing
Be explicit to really reveal the fact that messages are being passed

*Objects and classes are one in the same!*

## Now we can talk about a narrative

Gives student a thread to follow

Object.new
 * A message called new
 * Can be sent to any class
 * Gives you back and instance of that class
 * We give a name to the object

Helps student link in their minds exactly what is happening!

Kernal.puts is better than puts since mixins are too complicated for now
Keep the student on the narrative instead of going down a tangent

## What have we introducted at this point?

Objects have methods which accept and send messages
Introduce Classes except Class is a Class which creates new Classes

## Wrap up

*Teach objects with Ruby instead of teach Ruby with objects*
Better foundation because Ruby cares about Objects and how they interact
