When and How to Expose Services
===============================

* E.g. split out billing service for all their apps
  * 37ui for sharing UI code, assets
* Keeping plugins current: cached_externsal + Bundler (newer projects)
* Rails versions (none stable??)


* Engine-style plugin for shared models with a shared database
