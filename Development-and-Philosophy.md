## Notes

From @benjaminoakes:

* A lot of info can be found on Wikipedia (see there for more)
* **Human**ities are important
* Refinement -- you see more the second time you read something
* Rewarding to study this
* Monocultures = death
    * Get out of your filter bubble

Philosophy

* "love of wisdom"
* Get to the root causes of things -- _general and fundamental_ problems
