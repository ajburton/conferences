## Summary

The software world doesn't exist in a void;  we can learn a lot by studying philosophy and related subjects.  This talk was wide ranging, and was more about planting the seed of knowledge than anything.

Watching the video is encouraged, once available.

## Memorable Quotes

* "Logic'd!'
* "We aspire to be evil as well"
