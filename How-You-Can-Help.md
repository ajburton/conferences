## Helpful Hints

Run into a problem?  Contact [newhaven.rb on Twitter](http://twitter.com/newhavenrb).

* Most easy changes can be made via the web interface.
* If you want to work with a local clone, there's a [[software]] list that might help you out.
* If you're not a member of the [newhavenrb](https://github.com/newhavenrb) organization, you can't `git push` to the wiki repository.  We'll be happy to give you this access to contribute, but another option is [forking and making a pull request](https://github.com/newhavenrb/railsconf2012).  NOTE: the "code" repository may be out of date.

## Things You Can Do

You can make any improvement that you'd like, but here are some ideas:

### For Anyone

If you feel like you need to coordinate on a task, consider adding a bullet point below with your GitHub username.

#### Easy

* **Pass the word along!**  The more eyes and contributors, the better.  Examples:  tweet, email, tell a coworker.
* **Just read the notes.**  Fixing typos, awkward/confusing wording comes naturally.
* **Start a discussion!**  One example of this is [[the DHH keynote|David Heinemeier Hansson Keynote]].  Also, see the [[template]].
* **Check spelling.**  Many of these notes were written without a spell checker (e.g., in `vim` without having done `:set spell`).  The programs `aspell` and `ispell` might be useful also.

#### Medium

* **Add links.**  It would be great to have a comprehensive list of links to slides, gems, related sites, videos, etc.
* **Contribute notes.**  Talks missing notes are marked with "TODO" on the [[index|Home]].
* **Add/integrate notes you've taken yourself.**  Please add a section (`### From @username`) if you're adding a large block of notes to help reduce merge conflicts.
* **Improve a talk summary.**  One person's summary might not be entirely accurate.
* **Find more notes.** Search for "railsconf" or "railsconf2012" on GitHub (or even Google) for people who may be interested in contributing.
* **Look for TODOs.** `grep` for "TODO", "FIXME" for (simple) tasks.

#### Medium-Hard

* **Write a talk summary.**  Some of the abstracts are a bit long, and sometimes not entirely accurate.  Having 3-4 sentences/bullets to summarize would be nice.  Also, see the [[template]].
* **Work toward a single layout.**  Adjust existing notes to fit the suggested [[template]], if it makes sense to do so.

#### Hard

* **Combine notes.**  Many talks had notes taken by multiple people.  It would make sense to merge them.  This shouldn't be too bad, but will require more thought than the above tasks.

### For newhaven.rb Members

* **Merge pull requests** if there are any.
* **Add analytics.** Figure out if we can use our existing Google Analytics account with this (e.g. via `_Footer.md`).  GitHub doesn't provide great analytics on a page-by-page level.
