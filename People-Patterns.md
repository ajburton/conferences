## Abstract

> We spend a large portion of our time thinking about code and technical
> project issues. What about the people side of things? The majority of
> project failures occur because of people, not technology. What we need
> are guides that help us navigate the waters between the people around
> us.

> People Patterns introduces my latest effort to capture the subtleties
> and nuances of interpersonal relations. I'm distilling a lot of
> experience, a bit of psychology and a substantial amount of research
> and have come up with a series of patterns that can help everyone be
> more successful in teams and at work. How do you have those critical
> conversations? How do you get your point across when you think the
> other person is incompetent? Come and help me reveal these and join a
> lively discussion.
