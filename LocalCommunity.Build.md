> The talk will focus on <= 1 day length events that any Rubyists can organize in their locality to nurture and grow a vibrant ruby community.
Specifically, the talk will explore in detail two such events - Code Retreat & Rails Bugmash, and will be based on my experience in organizing Code Retreats in Boulder (Feb 2011) & Fort Collins (June 2011), and Rails Bugmashes in Boulder and Bangalore (both in May 2011).

Presenter: @_prakas, from Boulder Ruby Group

Ideas
-----

* Code Retreats
* Bugmashes
* Me: giving back to the community
  * OpenGov
  * Nonprofit
  * Idea: App for organizing giving back to the community?

Code Retreat
------------

* Goal: learning from others
* Day-long
* Single problem (e.g. Conway's Game of Life)
* 45 minute iterations
* Pair programming
* Delete code after each iteration
  * Qs
    * What did they learn?
    * Surprised the most?
    * What do differently from now on?
* Stand up: 15 min retrospective and break
* Switch partners, start again
* Learn!
* Anyone can participate and learn, regardless of skill level.  (Spread out skill level!)
* Don't analyze the problem too much; you're learning different approaches to coding
* How many people needed?
  * At least 2

Bug Mash
--------

* E.g., Rails bugmash: contribute bugfixes to Rails
* See Rails Guides: Contributing to Ruby on Rails http://guides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html
* Do pull requests
* Rebase so you have fewer commits, potentially

How?
----

* Bugmash Location
  * Someplace people can be for 5-6 hours
  * Local company
  * Coworking space
  * Coffee shop
* Code Retreat Location
  * More work
  * Sponsors for (catered) lunch, coffee, breakfast, other expenses
  * Facilitators -- someone else who knows the ropes
  * Coworking spaces are good options as sponsors
* Raising Sponsorships
  * Ask and you shall receive!
  * Coworking spaces
  * Local Ruby firms
  * Tech. book publishers
  * Tech. training companies
  * Recruiting firms
