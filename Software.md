If your Internet connection is good, all you need is a web browser.

To work offline, you'll at least need `git` and a text editor.

## Plugins

* `gollum`
    * [gollum](https://github.com/github/gollum): what GitHub made for `git`-based wikis.  (See also: [Fix `undefined method 'new' for Redcarpet:Module`](https://github.com/github/gollum/pull/271))  FIXME their latest relase might have fixed that; check and remove this notice if so.
* `vim`
    * [vim-markdown](https://github.com/tpope/vim-markdown): syntax, etc
    * [wikilink](https://github.com/mmai/wikilink): wiki navigation in `vim`
