Don't worry mate - everything's jake.

A typical American geek's impression of Australian English:
> * [Bart is showing Lisa his pocket knife] 
> * Australian with Spoon: You call that a knife? 
> * [the man pulls out a spoon] 
> * Australian with Spoon: *This* is a knife. 
> * Bart: [confused] That's not a knife, that's a spoon. 
> * Australian with Spoon: Alright, alright you win. I see you've played knifey-spoony before.
