## Intro
Name is from: Why is a raven like a writing desk?

### About Daniela
Always wanted to be a mathematician   
Mathematicians don't need to think about reality   
Mathematicians live in the world of concept   
Care about context of problem, not necessarily a solution   
Transitioned into Rails very quickly because TDD from the very get-go   
How does TDD relate to Math since I love them both so much?

### Induction
Recursion is based on induction   
Induction is away to prove things about integers   
If its true for 1, its true for 2, therefore, recursively, its true for all integers

#### Summation Notation
Sigma notation   
A mathematical loop   
Placement around sigma indicates location in equation   
(see slides)

### Integers
A programmers concept of an integer is different than a mathematicians   
A mathematicians uses axioms   
(see slides for Axiom of Induction)

You can't stub something out that means anything

Everything in Ruby is an Object   
7 is an instance of an Integer   
In Math, 7 comes with a lot of baggage   

### TDD is not a proof
Your test suite isn't a proof that you code works   
Its important to understand which function it provides   
**Unit tests are heuristics rather than proofs**
Before you solve a problem, you have to understand it   
If you do Outside-In-Development and start with integration tests, you will understand your problem   
You have to break problems down into smaller and smaller chunks until you find the easiest problem to solve   

Understanding math and understanding the differences between tests suites and proofs is very important because you can explain test driven development
