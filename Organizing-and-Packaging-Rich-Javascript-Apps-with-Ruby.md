## Notes

TODO

From @username1:

* This layout is just a suggestion.
* It's kinda based on how Wikipedia is organized (e.g. an "External Links" section)
* Bullet points might work well.  Paragraphs too.  Up to you.  :)
* This section is probably enough, but just in case here are some other ideas...

From @username2:

* It's best to leave "username dividers" to prevent merge conflicts later.

## Discussion

TODO

* If some stuff is controversial, thought provoking, etc, we can have something like this.
