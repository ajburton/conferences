## Abstract

> It takes more than talent to make a great product. You also have to focus on the right things, in the right order, with the right people at hand. Ryan will explain key points for successfully developing product so you can make the most progress on your big idea. The talk will cover common pitfalls, techniques for seeing the bigger picture, and advice on how to bring the different roles together.

## Notes

From @benjaminoakes:

* Hard to talk about product development; not tangible
* Not satisfying until you can go into the app as a user and experience it
* How do we bring developers, designers, and product together and always have them be awesome?
    * "Not ready to ship yet..."
* Needs to be fun
* Lots of roles (design, dev, marketing, etc)... almost like an org chart
    * None exist in a vacuum
    * Have to break out into indiv. pieces, but still have the same co-dependence
* How do you take on changes to something you already have?
* When does the feature stop?
* Firewheel: Diamond Way Buddhism event app
    * Allows embedding on other sites
    * People didn't like posting events...
    * But now it's something they do.
    * 1 hr a week
    * No admin!  Has to do `User.create(...)`, but it's pretty meaningless user-value-wise
    * How do you decide what to do, if you only have an hour?
