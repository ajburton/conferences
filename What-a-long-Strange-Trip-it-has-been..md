**Presenter:** Ezra Zygmuntowicz

## Bio

> Ezra Zygmuntowicz is one of the early pioneers in the rails space. He was one of three original founders of Engine Yard and spearheaded much of the open source culture and community support for ruby in general that the company was built on. He is the author of Deploying Rails Applications for there pragmatic programmers and released one of the earliest commercial websites written in Rails back in fall of 2004 for the Yakima Herald Republic Newspaper.
>
> Ezra is the "deployment guy", when you look back in history on the rails mailing list you will find literally thousands of posts about deployment and helping the community figure out how to deploy and scale rails apps when no one knew how to do it.
>
> Ezra has build multiple clouds from the ground up. One IaaS cloud for Engine Yard before there was the term cloud at all, before EC2 existed even. He also built 2 PaaS clouds, Appcloud, Engine Yard's current AWS PaaS platform and Cloud Foundry a VMWare project. I think it may be safe to say that he has deployed more rails apps personally then anyone else on the planet.
>
> Ezra is a speaker at many ruby and cloud related technology conferences and has spoken at every single railsconf since the first one but missed out on speaking at the last 2 events.
>
> Ezra has become a Extroverted Mad Scientist Recluse with entrepreneurial tendencies and more recently has gone back to his roots in the physical world building many embedded electronics projects, blowing glass artwork, building and using multiple 3d printers, CNC machines and Laser cutters and recently even built his own CO2 laser from scratch!.
>
> He has come full circle from artists to technologist and back again, this time applying the technology of rails, ruby,cloud and the internet to classic artwork in mediums like Glass, QWood, Metals and Plastics. He is now slowly building the Internet of Things.

## Abstract

> This talk will explore the story of Ezra's travels through the history of ancient Rails 0.6 when he first picked it up in 2004 all the way through current times and extrapolate out to the future of the Rails and Ruby platform and how much of a success it has been. We will talk about the twisting path from way back then to now and beyond and explore what Rails was, is and will be as time keeps on slipping into the future.
>
> This talk will be chock full of aqdvancxed tech as well as ramblings of a Rails industry Vet who has been "On the Rails" for *8* long years now and has played a major part in shaping what has been, is and will be(at least in his own mind where he is absolutely a legend, in reality he's just a schmuck who hacks ruby)
>
> I want to share with the Rails community my story and experiences and hopefully impart some wisdom and some hard learned lessons about life, liberty and the pursuit of a rails app that doesn't use 400Mb of RAM per process ;)
