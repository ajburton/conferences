## Notes

From @benjaminoakes:

* Apprentice -> Journeyman -> Master
* Shu -> Ha -> Ri
    * Rules and structure are what you hold true to at the beginning
    * Then you realize you can break some of the rules
    * Then everything is internalized

* Polyglot:  we're polyglots because of the various tools, etc we use as Rubyists
* T-Shaped people:  deep vertical skills, empathy with the rest of the team
* Personalities (Myers-Briggs)
* Fist to 5
    * You throw out your vote (0 - 5) on the count of three.
* Collaboration 8
    * 8 levels of how much you care, you vote separately on what you want yourself
        * Tell
        * Sell
        * Consult
        * Agree
        * Advise
        * Inquire
        * Delegate
        * Joker
* 6 Thinking hats
    * Edward DiBono
    * White, Red, Black, Yellow, Green, Blue -- each represents a basic modality of thought
    * Works because it is less offensive
    * Everyone wears the same hat at the same time
