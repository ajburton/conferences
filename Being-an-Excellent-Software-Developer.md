## Notes

From @benjaminoakes:

* Apprentice -> Journeyman -> Master
* Shu -> Ha -> Ri
    * Rules and structure are what you hold true to at the beginning
    * Then you realize you can break some of the rules
    * Then everything is internalized

* Polyglot:  we're polyglots because of the various tools, etc we use as Rubyists
* T-Shaped people:  deep vertical skills, empathy with the rest of the team
