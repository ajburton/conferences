## Abstract

> As of Rails 3.2, plugins are officially deprecated. They have been
> replaced by Rails Engines, a class of public methods for hooking into
> Rails applications. This session will explain how to write a Rails
> Engine from scratch or convert your existing plugin to an engine. It
> will also cover best practices for making your engine play well with
> others, and when to factor pieces of your existing Rails application
> code into an engine for reuse across multiple applications.

## Summary

* Rails Engines dates from Oct. 31, 2005!
* DHH was initially against engines.
* James Adam, creator of engines: "It would be madness to include
  them in the core of rails".

* Erik wrote MerbAdmin.
* Dec. 23, 2008 - Rails/Merb merger.
  * This killed Merb, but brought many ideas from Merb into Rails.

* 2010: Ruby Summer of Code - Piotr Sarnacki - Mountable Engines
