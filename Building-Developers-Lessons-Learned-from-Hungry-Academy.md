## Bio

> I love to teach Ruby. I’m currently running Hungry Academy, a full-time training program for new developers, in partnership with LivingSocial.

## Abstract

> Earlier this year we started Hungry Academy with 24 people, most of them with no programming experience whatsoever, and a plan to get them ready for the LivingSocial engineering team in five months. Here’s the quick story of what’s worked, what hasn’t, and the lessons learned as we try to solve the developer shortage.

## Notes

TODO

From @username1:

* This layout is just a suggestion.
* It's kinda based on how Wikipedia is organized (e.g. an "External Links" section)
* Bullet points might work well.  Paragraphs too.  Up to you.  :)
* This section is probably enough, but just in case here are some other ideas...

From @username2:

* It's best to leave "username dividers" to prevent merge conflicts later.

## Discussion

TODO

* If some stuff is controversial, thought provoking, etc, we can have something like this.
* Kind of like "Talk" pages on Wikipedia.
