## Abstract

> “A testing tool by any other other name would assert as truthy.” – some guy.  You’ve seen Rails’ built-in Test::Unit in the morning session.  This afternoon, we’ll introduce RSpec, another popular testing tool.  We’ll overview basic structure, contexts, “should” expectations, mocking and stubbing.  We’ll also cover Rails model, view, controller, routing, helper, and request specs.
