# People, The Missing Ingredient

### Introduction
People, Process, Technology

People are more important!

I've never seen a project succeed for technical reason.   
Its always the people on the project that make it or break it.

Pay attention to your brain! Break it down and understand it.

### People Patterns
Read the Pragmatic Programmer one chapter at a time   
No more than a chapter a week   
Digest!

People Patterns are a series of solutions that can be applied:

1. **Conversation Rolodex**

   Meet twenty new people you've never met before   
   To be successful at this, keep a set of **conversation starters** in your _Conversation Rolodex_

   Have another question! Always be interested in their answers.

2. **Voices In Your Head: They Don't Go Away**

   Psychological protection mechanisms   
   Brain puts up barriers to make sure you don't get hurt   
   Don't listen to the voices   
   Once you get passed them, you'll be successful

3. **What Do _They_ See?**

   Purposely pick a different angle to your own opinions

   Arguments and conflicts almost always come down to what you see

   Understand what other people are seeing at that moment

4. **The Three Realities**

   1. One you see
   2. The one he/she sees
   3. Actual reality

   With reflection, you can see the actual reality   
   Remove your cognitive biases  
   Look without emotion

5. **Listen Without Agenda**

   Accomplish **The Three Realities** by _Listening Without Agenda_

   Everyone has an agenda   
   Your brain is always going and not allowing you to listen

6. **Reveal Bad News Quickly**

   Bad news is an acid that sits on your brain

   "Project is delayed because we forgot to implement a key component"

   What do you do? We sit and digest and try to fix.

   We never think about corollary and just get it out there!

   Agile development exists to catch mistakes early!

   Take ownership of a mistake

   Good news: 
    * Weight will be lifted when Bad News is released
     * PM won't be happy if you sit on the news
    * Sitting on problem says you don't trust other stakeholders to help/fix

   *Always close the loop!*    
   Make sure to communicate you've finished

7. **Consistent Uncompromising Honesty**

   Absolutely no reason to be dishonest

8. **Listen Between The Lines**

   "How is George doing?"

9. **Positivity Moves Forward**

   Two most important words from Improv:
   1. Yes
   2. And

   Understand that people can have ideas that might be different

10. **Assume The Positive**

   Always be an optimist!

   Pessimism is a defense mechanism

   Things move forward faster when you believe a situation will be positive

   Coming into a transaction with a negative outlook pollutes transaction
