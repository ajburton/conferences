**Presenter:** Ruby Rogues Live

## Abstract

> Ruby's favorite podcast comes to RailsConf! Join the Ruby Rogues (David Brady, James Edward Gray II, Avdi Grimm, Josh Susser, and Charles Max Wood) for this live episode on What Rails Developers Should Care About.
>
> If you've listened to the show, you probably know that the Rogues favor:
>
> * Good Object Oriented design
> * Patterns
> * Test Driven Development
> * The Law of Demeter and Tell, Don't Ask
> * Open source
> * Beautiful code
> * Pair programming
> * Code metrics
> * Scaling performant code
> * and more
>
> Since this is a live episode, we want to interact with the audience. Each Rogue will give a brief introduction on what's important to him as a Rubyist on Rails, then we will turn the session over to your questions. We will take them over the Internet and/or live, before and during the show.
>
> All that AND we promise to wear amazing hats!
