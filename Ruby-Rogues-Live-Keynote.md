**Presenter:** Ruby Rogues Live

## Abstract

> Ruby's favorite podcast comes to RailsConf! Join the Ruby Rogues (David Brady, James Edward Gray II, Avdi Grimm, Josh Susser, and Charles Max Wood) for this live episode on What Rails Developers Should Care About.
>
> If you've listened to the show, you probably know that the Rogues favor:
>
> * Good Object Oriented design
> * Patterns
> * Test Driven Development
> * The Law of Demeter and Tell, Don't Ask
> * Open source
> * Beautiful code
> * Pair programming
> * Code metrics
> * Scaling performant code
> * and more
>
> Since this is a live episode, we want to interact with the audience. Each Rogue will give a brief introduction on what's important to him as a Rubyist on Rails, then we will turn the session over to your questions. We will take them over the Internet and/or live, before and during the show.

What should a Rails Dev care about? FIREFLY

Dan Kubb: "All code is experimental." @jeg2's favorite rogue moment.

How does something get invented?

Example: tracking Sputnik, using the doppler effect with its beeps, to
reverse-engineer its path through orbit; that was reverseable, and
then was used to track nuclear submarines through the ocean, then
Regean opened it up.

Controlling Asperger's: imitating proper behavior.  "The Journal of
Best Practices," by David Finch - he learned how to imitate
empathy. But, sometimes, things just go wrong. "Here's your new best
practice: not everything is a best practice."

#### @avdi

Introspection

He spent a recent week at Hashrocket, and was asking himself, "why
me?" Because "you don't just have an idea, you speak up, you give a name to
it, you explain why."

Mindful coding

(its opposite, "shut up and code")

...which is acceptable, sometimes, in the dev team room, but terrible
for online discussion. Look at how good c2.com/wiki is. "Thank
goodness they didn't shut up & code."

"Pattern: a decision an expert makes over & over." -Kent Beck

So: when you decide something, name it.
* Write code
* Think about it
* Explain it to someone else
* Not just what, but why

#### David Brady

Antipatterns!

Being fresh off the PHP boat (not an actual anti-pattern)

Don't program FORTRAN in Ruby. Ruby is not a BOLS language:
block-oriented, lexically scoped. Learn Ruby, as if it were a whole
new language.

Know that JavaScript is CRAP.
Know JavaScript.
Know CoffeeScript.

Let Rails do the OO for you.
Don't join in the community: learn, and then teach.

#### @joshsusser

Prudence

Prudent: acting with, or showing care and thought for the future.
Most of the cost of owning code is the maintenance cost.

Fear of Progress?  DHH said loss aversion is the pillar of
conservatism.  tenderlove said experienced devs have a lower tolerance
for technical debt. Instead: we have a limited budget for risk in our
projects. I hate having other people spend my risk budget for
me. Asset Pipeline spent my risk tolerance, bundler saved me some risk
budget.

"Be regular and orderly in your life like a bourgeois, so that you may
be violently original in your work." - Gustave Flaubert


#### Charles Max Wood

Hey, we need more Rails devs, right? Let's go make some converts! We
need missionaries and evangelists. We should convince devs to try ruby
& rails, and convince companies to try it. We don't want to slow down
for them to come up to speed, but we should "put the ball in front of
them, & help them score." We need to start w/ the devs, & then
convince them to convince their companies.

ShowMeDo - a learning community for python
pluralsight
JPassion.com - java guys
O'Reilly school of tech - no strong ruby material

Reach out, teach people, and make them our skunks-works, our
moles. Then, we'll have more devs, more companies who'll train devs,
etc. As you do this, speak up at http://parlay.rubyrogues.com.

## Q&A

* What about Rich Hickey's comments, about simplicity? Wouldn't that
mean lots of naked information?

JEG2: Yep. Simple + simple + simple doesn't guarantee simple.

JS: Rich was talking FP, and that's a fundamentally different
thing. I'm done waiting for it to become popular.

* What's a bad use of instance_exec?

* I think we need to do more evangelizing & teaching

CMW: Yeah, teaching ladies to code, etc...lots of good programs out
there. We should open our companies up, too, so people can see what we
do.

JS: Rails bridge is teaching new rails devs, esp. women. Go volunteer
for Rails Bridge!

DB: get away from programming water-holes, talk to non-devs. Start-up
weekends, etc. People w/ biz ideas who can't program.

JEG2: Yep. Sometimes just set up a wiki for a group like that.

* WHen is the Rails community gonna be half-women?

JS: yeah, that's important - we're trying.

CMW: respect is kind of the baseline. Rails bridge really gets it. But
be friendly - women like other people like them.

JEG2: Angela's Rogues episode is everyone's favorite.

Evan Phoenix: How many of us got started programming in highschool or
earlier? (lots) We should try to get kids involved.

* What are some good examples of cross-pollination between langs?

JEG2: lots of examples between ruby, javascript, coffeescript,
bash...ruby does a pretty good job of using different langs for their
strengths.

JS: Ruby has taken lots from java & python, and it's also lisp +
smalltalk, with perl.

* Sarah from Rails bridge: I'm bringing women into the rails community
because the men are awesome. We get 1/2 devs from other langs, & 1/2
totally new to programming. We want to get them to know the people in
the community, to encourage them to come to confs.

JEG2: when will you be coming on the podcast?

* There was a question about FP not succeeding since the 50's, but why
should we care about OO paradigm - shouldn't we care about Ruby or
Rails paradigm?

CMW: yeah, we need to use the FP & OOP parts in balance.

AG: all sufficiently systems evolve into OO systems. Evidence: look at
the architecture of a large system, it's all boxes & arrows, with
well-defined protocols between them. That encapsulation keeps us
sane. The question is, shouldn't we have that cellular structure at
lower levels, too?

DB: Good FP & good OO keep things encapsulated - immutability, & info
hiding. You can use that stuff in Ruby, it's pretty seamless,
switching between them.

JS: Ruby seems better at the FP/OO blend than JavaScript does.

AG: GOOSGBT talks about this blend - method internals are functional,
and the interface is more about mutable state.
