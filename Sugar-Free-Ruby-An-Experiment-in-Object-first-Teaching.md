## Bio

> During the school year, Steven! is a student of computer science,
> mathematics, and latte art, and this past summer he interned at
> GitHub. Year-round he's a passionate Ruby hacker who loves
> contributing to open source projects like Faraday, Rubinius and
> Archlinux. He teaches and contributes to KidsRuby, CoderDojo, and
> Rails Girls and is also on the core team for RailsBridge. He has spent
> more than a few evenings scrabbling to get out of the Bronze League in
> StarCraft II. Most importantly, Steven! is a dedicated engineer with a
> passion for creating beautiful things.

## Abstract

> Ruby has a lot of syntax to come to terms with. In an effort to reduce
> learning overhead we often restrict what we teach by avoiding serious
> coverage of objects in early lessons. Yet objects are what make Ruby
> great. Rather than sacrifice Object Oriented Mechanics, Sugar-free
> ruby uses a minimum of syntactic sugar to reinforce the
> message-passing objective semantics of Ruby until the pupil
> understands and then can assimilate new syntactic elements with
> greater ease. This talk explores the advantages and pitfalls of the
> technique as well as other ways to teach Ruby.

## Notes

* Teaching programming is really, really hard.
* Programming tkes a lot of self-reflection to teach well.
* It's getting better: Hungry Academy, Rails Bridge, etc.
* CoderDojo: Kids programming clubs
  * Game Builder, Scratch, Python, Hackety-Hack / Shoes
  * Most important lesson: Programming is Fun
* RailsBridge: Workshops for Women
  * Trying to install "Programming is Hard, but it's attainable"
* Teaching Ruby: the challenge is finding out why your students want to
  learn ruby.
* Teaching Ruby the good old fashioned way
  * Start with data types: integers, floats, strings, symbols, booleans
    arrays, hashes, variable assignment, conditionals, loops, etc.
  * Maybe if there's time, get to methods.
  * What's wrong with this: 6 concepts come before methods.
    No mention whatsoever of objects or classes.
* "Ruby is not a computer language" -- it doesn't care about
  that it runs on a computer.
* Let's teach objects and treat ruby as the computer.
* IRB is the best tool for learning ruby.
* How Steven teaches:
  * Everything is an object
  * They receive messages -- use `send` to show this.
  * Objects have a class
  * Instantiation with new; variable assignemtn as "giving an object a
    name"
  * Method definition
  * Introduce dot-syntax for calling methods.
  * Errors are your Friends -- try calling undefined methods
  * Use `Kernel.puts` as it is less "magical" than just "puts"
  * Define an accessor method, use an instance variable
  * Implicit receivers
  * Use conditionals to accomplish a goal.
  * Demonstrate creating a class with `Class.new`
  * This is focused on teaching objects with ruby.
* This is better because the object metaphor provides a
  context for everything else we learn about Ruby.
