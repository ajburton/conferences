Mining Rails
============

* Not so much process, more about the product (code)

Metrics
-------

* LOC not a good metric (normalize against the language, at least)
* Cyclomatic Complexity (decision points), a little dated (only really whiles and ifs), but still indicative
* Flog: weighting for complexity
* But: we have history!
* Universal truths?  Maybe not...
* Queries against git logs
* Social science (article about parole hearings)

* Commits are patterned -- lots around 17:00
* Beware noise
* Can detect refacoring from method lifelines
* Can learn more about you do, things you can act on

* complexity from flog

Q: Have you done any analysis to discover root causes for problems?
