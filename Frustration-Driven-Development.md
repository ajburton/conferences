## Abstract

> Everyone draws inspiration and motivation from different sources.
> 
> For most, itâ€™s often frustration.
> 
> We make life decisions, define new features, or refactor code when we get too annoyed by current circumstances. This is where Evan admits that he has a low tolerance for frustration. Having been frustrated a great deal during his career, Evan will discuss several anti-patterns that he has seen in code and how to use the Dark Side of the Force (frustration, anger, and rage) to escape from them.
