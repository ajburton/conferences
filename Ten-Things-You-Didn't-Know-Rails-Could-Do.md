**Presenter:** James Edward Gray II

## Bio

> James (@JEG2) has been a Rails programmer for about as long as it has been fashionable to be one and a Rubyist even longer than that.  As you probably know from listening to him on the Ruby Rogues podcast, James loves to dig into how our community and code works.

## Abstract

> Rails is huge.  Even if you have worked with it for a long time, it's unlikely that you have stumbled across everything yet.
>
> Do you really know what all of the built-in Rake tasks do?  Have you seen all of the methods ActiveSupport makes available to you?  Are you aware of all the queries ActiveRecord is capable of?
>
> In this talk, I'll dig into the extras of Rails and see if I can't turn up some features that you don't see all of the time, but that might just be handy to know about anyway.  I'll make sure you come out of this able to impress your friends at the hackfest.
