**Presenter:** Jerry Cheung

## Bio

> Jerry Cheung splits his time as a co-founder of Opperator and a developer at Intridea. He is a co-author of the upcoming MacRuby in Action, and likes contributing to open source. He's currently dabbling in evented Ruby and Grape driven webapps. When he's not coding, he stalks awesome cars in Southern California and writes about them in RockyRoadBlog.

## Abstract

> While Node.js is the hot new kid on the block, evented libraries like EventMachine for Ruby and Twisted for Python have existed for a long time. When does it make sense to use one over the other? What are the advantages and disadvantages to using node over ruby? In this talk, you will learn how to get the same power of concurrency enjoyed by Node.js while continuing to write in the language you know and love. Topics covered will include pubsub with redis or faye, building evented rack applications, and running evented applications alongside existing Rails apps.
