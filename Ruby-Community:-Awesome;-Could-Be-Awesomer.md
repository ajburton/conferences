> We are known for our community. Does this mean our job is done? Are we starting to stagnate? Simply gathering Rubyists together isn't enough. How are you improving your community? Fear not as anyone of you can take action. Whether you live in a place with no organized Ruby meet-ups or you're contemplating a big regional event, we will go over why you should take action and give you practical steps to do so.
