### From @benjaminoakes

* "Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability."  - Dijsktra
* Conflated words:
    * Sim=plex: "one fold/braid"
    * Easy: "lie near"
* Easy
    * Near, at hand (part of your toolkit, etc)
    * Close to your understanding/familiar
    * Near our capabilities; about our mental work
    * How much complexity can we take on?
    * What's easy to **you** might not be easy for someone else
* Limits
    * 7 +/- 2 (from psychology)
    * Intertwined things (coupled?) make change more difficult
* Change
    * ...is the operative word
    * Size/complexity of software **is** the limit
    * Being able to reason, etc. is critical
* Simplicity
    * Process isn't important; architectural agility is
    * Is design demonized?
        * "Grand plans" isn't design
        * Taking things apart is the goal
        * Goal: simple compontents
