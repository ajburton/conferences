### From @benjaminoakes

* Conflated words:
    * Sim=plex: "one fold/braid"
    * Easy: "lie near"
* Easy
    * Near, at hand (part of your toolkit, etc)
    * Close to your understanding/familiar
    * Near our capabilities; about our mental work
    * How much complexity can we take on?
    * What's easy to **you** might not be easy for someone else
* Limits
    * 7 +/- 2 (from psychology)
    * Intertwined things (coupled?) make change more difficult
* Change
    * ...is the operative word
    * Size/complexity of software **is** the limit
    * Being able to reason, etc. is critical
* Simplicity
    * Process isn't important; architectural agility is
    * Is design demonized?
        * "Grand plans" isn't design
        * Taking things apart is the goal
        * Goal: simple compontents
* The "Kazoo" Fighers
    * Do you want to be in a band that consistently chooses the easiest thing?
* Homogenaeity
    * You're more replacable if there's homogenaeity
    * Too much focus on ourselves rather than our programs
* "Complect"
    * Taking more than one thing and tying it together in a knot
* Easy isn't bad
    * You can become familiar
    * Learning new things is good
    * Getting smarter is hard
    * Easy is best in all three senses
* Simpler components
    * Simpler languages, techniques, approaches
    * Same programs!
    * What are some options? (see slides if posted; there's a table)
    * Simplicity is hard work, but there's a huge payoff.
    * Constatin Brancusi quote
* Order is complex
    * "The order problem"
    * Makes every use more complex
    * Positional arguments vs named arguments (or a hashmap)
    * This is "syntax vs data"!
    * See table
    * Leverage hashes in your language; use them often
* Information is simple
    * Classes can make things more complex
    * Makes generic manipulation harder
    * Information **doesn't have** implementation
    * Information **has** representation
